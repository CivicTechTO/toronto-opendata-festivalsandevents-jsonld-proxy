To start, eight of Toronto's funniest comedians present character monologues from fiction, history, TV, film and other weirdly specific niches. \n\nIn part two, the audience decides which characters will perform hilarious improv scenes together. Maybe Linda Belcher of Bob’s Burgers will be in a budget meeting with the real Walt Disney? Maybe Rocky Balboa will be roommates with Kermit the Frog? In World’s Collide, the audience builds a new franchise that is canonically wrong, but oh so right.", "url": "https://www.secondcity.com/shows/toronto/worlds-collide-tor", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/Screenshot 2025-03-19 151647_QpMW2jBCkEFbCY1Kxh9R2g.png", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Kicks and Giggles", "email": "damien@wantandable.ca", "telephone": "4166934425"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Comedy", "Theatre"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": 25, "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://www.secondcity.com/shows/toronto/worlds-collide-tor"}}
