Discover rarely seen artifacts from the City’s collections and items from community members, the exhibition invites you to explore the many ways we define, create, and carry home with us. From a World War One soldier’s return ticket home to a precious family object stewarded by multiple generations, you’ll encounter belongings, voices, and stories of Toronto artists, makers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders as they share their unique perspectives on belonging, identity, and place. These powerful objects offer fresh, heartfelt perspectives on what it means to find, make, or remember home.  \n\nAt Home in Toronto includes the artworks of Rebecca Baird, Carl Beam, Fred Hagan, Robert Houle, Luis Jacob, Kit Li, Raoul Olou, Yasmine Louis, and Natalie Wood, as well as loaned works by Toronto artists Doug Brown and Frantz Brent-Harris.", "url": "https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/market-gallery/", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/Doll House_smaller_1wLlbaDu5wIVYgv8CzjZYA.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "City of Toronto Museums & Heritage Services", "email": "jacquie.gardner@toronto.ca", "telephone": "4167045915"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "History", "Indigenous", "Museum"]}
