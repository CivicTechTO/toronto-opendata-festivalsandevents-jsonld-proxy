It follows Sharon, a Métis woman born in India, who returned to her ancestral home in Alberta as a teenager, forever caught between cultures. Now an adult, she finds herself at a lavish foodie dinner party hosted by her longtime paramour, marking the unofficial 20th anniversary of their extramarital affair. But as the evening unfolds, simmering tensions boil over—her Indigenous knowledge is both appropriated and fetishized. In the face of erasure and exploitation, can her Kohkom’s teachings guide her toward healing?", "url": "https://www.soulpepper.ca/performances/takwahiminana", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/Screenshot 2025-03-20 100642_gVrbPts0s89aa_Pj6L36FQ.png", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Punctuate!
