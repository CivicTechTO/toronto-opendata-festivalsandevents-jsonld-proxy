A new installation offers a window into the pleasures, pastimes, and artistic heritage of Iran during the Safavid dynasty (1501-1736). A royal picnic, depicted on a large, treasured tile arch from the collections, is complemented by exceptional objects from the period.\n\nA colourful tiled archway made over 350 years ago in Isfahan, Iran takes centre stage, showing picnic-goers out for an afternoon of leisure and luxury. Individual tiles reveal immaculately dressed figures relaxing, enjoying delicious food and drink, and being entertained with music, poetry, and feats of archery.",

Drawing upon various spiritual traditions, mythologies, and rituals, Whiten's work evades easy categorization, manifesting itself in ways that are spellbinding and technically profound.\n\nThe more than 30 works on display range from works on paper and cotton, to sculpture, other three-dimensional objects, and mixed media installations.  The exhibition features many of the artist's most essential works, made with organic matter such as leather, bone, and stone, and precarious materials such as glass and crystal.",

    "description": "Toronto-based textile artist Justin Ming Yong, unveils \"Blur\" this spring. This exciting site-specific project by Yong will transform the museum's elevators as well as the North End Gallery into immersive art spaces. \n\nYong has developed a textile practice that reinterprets traditional quilt-making—a craft passed down to him by his mother, an avid quilt-maker. This practice, rooted in centuries-old cultural traditions, considers the interplay of colour, pattern, and geometry. His works, crafted from diverse materials and layered prints, balance harmony and tension, resulting in abstract compositions that are both gestural and hard-edged.\n\nExplore \"Blur\" and see how Yong's vibrant quilts reshape familiar spaces.",

    "description": "Takwahiminana [\"TAK-wa-HI-mi-na-na\" A Cree and Michif word for chokecherry] is a darkly funny exploration of love, identity, and cultural collision. It follows Sharon, a Métis woman born in India, who returned to her ancestral home in Alberta as a teenager, forever caught between cultures. Now an adult, she finds herself at a lavish foodie dinner party hosted by her longtime paramour, marking the unofficial 20th anniversary of their extramarital affair. But as the evening unfolds, simmering tensions boil over—her Indigenous knowledge is both appropriated and fetishized. In the face of erasure and exploitation, can her Kohkom's teachings guide her toward healing?",

    "description": "Originally Based on John Gay's 18th century ballad opera The Beggar's Opera, The Threepenny Opera has long excited audiences with its unfiltered, confrontational narrative as well as its social commentary. Written in 1928, Brecht's cutting satirical critique of capitalism takes us through Victorian London's Soho where we are plunged into the seedy underbelly of the Savoy Hotel, Grape Lane Brothel, and Peachum's Emporium for Beggars. Timely and prophetic, Brecht deftly blurs the lines between a hypocritical bourgeois society, with its wealthy, corrupt power brokers, and the criminal underworld of cut-throats, thieves and whores.",

Seven years later they each published a set of six quartets: Mozart's are well-known and much beloved, but the Bologne works are only recently rediscovered. \n\nLucky for music lovers, the Eybler Quartet has continued its exploration of the recently rediscovered Op. 14 string quartets of Joseph Bologne, pairing them with the revered quartets of Wolfgang Mozart dedicated to Haydn. This is a unique opportunity to experience one of Canada's best string quartets in an intimate and authentic setting.",

Admire treasures from the collections, as Keynote Speaker Dr. Sooa Im McCormick (Korea Foundation Curator of Korean Art of The Cleveland Museum of Art) is joined by panelists Dr. Soren Brothers (Allan and Helaine Shiff Curator of Climate Change) and Dr. Vicki Sung-yeon Kwon (Associate Curator of Korean Art and Culture, Royal Ontario Museum) to discuss this issue's effect on Korea's Joseon dynasty (1392 to 1910).\n\nThe Little Ice Age (late 14th to 19th century), a period of catastrophic global climate change caused failed harvests, famines, and epidemics all over the Northern Hemisphere, including Canada and Korea. Its impact in Korea was felt acutely in the 18th century leading to dramatic changes in visual and material culture still felt today.\n\nThe presentation will be followed by Korean-inspired refreshments and a performance of Korean traditional music quartet Haneum.",

Into his empty audition room storms an equally desperate actress—with connections to the material that seem to be too coincidental to be true.",

These dramatic events have played out in front of huge crowds and been followed by generations of fans, profoundly influencing the way Torontonians see themselves and their city. \n\nCome a little early with your skates to take advantage of Mattamy Athletic Centre's indoor ice rink - and skate in the same space that historic Toronto sports legends have made history.",

    "description": "The unemployed donkeys have one demand: the humans must surrender their machines and give all donkeys their jobs back. But revolution is never easy!\n\nasses.masses is a custom-made video game about labour, technophobia and sharing the load of revolution, designed to be played from beginning to end in a live theatre. This is a full day experience with gaming as performance; an immersive, cheeky and highly original work. Brave spectators take turns at the controller to lead the herd through a post-Industrial society, where asses are valued more for their hides than their potential.\n\nThis game is as if Animal Farm meets Pokémon meets Final Fantasy: as exciting in form as it is in content. No previous gaming (or donkey) experience required.",

After the performance, there will be some of the city's best DJs playing classic reggae and dancehall 45s.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to catch a budding star in an intimate setting before it's too late.",

It invites us to reflect on what's ready to fall away, welcome what's ready to bloom, and reattune to the deeper rhythm of our lives. Together, we'll take this time to pause, reconnect, and step into the season with clarity and intention.\n\nNo experience is needed - just bring yourself, your breath, and an open heart.",

The work specializes in themes regarding feminism, social change, humour, pop culture, politics and romance.

He is a former member of Nu Guinea, Nuova Napoli Band and is involved and engaged in the Italian scene of radical improvisation. The compositions are inspired by the idea of natural biodiversity as an expression of contamination, coexistence and balance. Multiculturalism becomes coexistence.

Power, desire, and ambition intertwine in this masterly work by Claudio Monteverdi, his last opera. \n\nConducted by Leonardo García-Alarcón at the helm of Cappella Mediterranea, the concert version reveals the full dramatic power of this timeless opera. This production will tour Cologne, Geneva, Namur, Montreal, Toronto, and New York. Join us for a champagne reception for the entire audience after the concert!",

    "description": "The purpose of this survey is to engage the public and to gather feedback to inform the City of Toronto's 10-year Circular Economy Road Map. The City of Toronto is developing a 10-year Circular Economy Road Map to tackle some of today's most urgent challenges — the growing landfill capacity issues, affordability and rising living costs, climate change, and the clear need for more resilient, local systems. The term \"circular economy\" refers to a society-wide approach to production and consumption that aims to eliminate landfill waste and maximize resources by recovering as much as possible. It is a system where everything we use – from buildings and food, to clothing and electronics – never becomes waste. Instead, they remain in circulation through processes like redesign, reduction, reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling, and recovery.",

    "description": "Written by William Shakespeare, and directed by Nicholas Koy Santillo witness four actors, two households, and one absolute banger.\n\nWhat was Shakespeare before stage lights, microphones and the Fourth Wall? Before he was revered and canonized, Shakespeare's plays were raucous, irreverent and relevant. When first staged in 1596, Romeo and Juliet referenced contemporary politics and the eternal human condition. \n\nThis summer, whether you're in Verona or Toronto, one thing is certain - the day is hot, the Capulets abroad.",

Together, these artists create a textured narrative that recognizes fashion not only as clothing or ornamentation, but as a profound mode of storytelling.",

Using speculative storytelling and myth-making through film-based works, this exhibition brings a sense of immediacy to our planet's growing climate crisis and the environmental dangers that feel distant or out of sight.",

It considers multiple layers of engagement with the land, including a history of land defense movements, medicine walks, and ancestral practices of prescribed burns, alongside contemporary art.\n\nFeatured artists include Michael Belmore, BUSH Gallery (Gabrielle L'Hirondelle Hill, Peter Morin, Tania Willard), Faye HeavyShield, Art Hunter, Alex Jacobs-Blum, Mike MacDonald, Lisa Myers, Edward Poitras, and Protect the Tract Collective.",

It's a nod to global (or even galactic) unity, and to the idea that despite all the noise and division, we're more alike than not. \n\nIn her Canadian debut, Intergalactic Planetary brings together imagery and works inspired by cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Berlin, Tokyo, Bangkok and locations across the United States. Snelling explains, \"Through this work, I ask: how can we move beyond our fears, borders, and egos to become more humane? Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future\".\n\nJoin us on Nuit Blanche to view the exhibition's works, while DJ beats set the mood with dynamic sounds and enjoy two exhibition-inspired cocktails-one coffee-based and the other with an intergalactic twist.",

    "description": "The most talked about play of the decade.\n\nSharp, provocative, and wildly entertaining theatrical sensation that has sparked conversations from Broadway to London. Now making its Canadian premiere, this electrifying play by Jeremy O. Harris turns up the heat on love, race, and relationships in ways that are bold, unexpected, and impossible to forget.  \n\nA daring, seductive, and razor-sharp satire, audiences will be on a journey where pleasure and history meet, flipping assumptions and igniting sparks along the way. It's a show that's as playfully cheeky as it is thought-provoking, designed to make you feel, think, and maybe even blush.",

It may seem like a shopping bag is just a vessel for carrying goods, but it can tell a larger story.

    "description": "The first and largest arts and mental health festival in North America. Using art as the entry point to illuminate and investigate the realities and mythologies surrounding mental illness and addiction, we are spotlighting the human capacity for endurance in the face of great challenges. \n\nThe theme this year is \"Disrupt the Focus\", a statement that questions which narratives are emphasized, and which are silenced. \n\nThis is a platform for artists, whose lived experience expands our understanding of living with mental health and addiction. To disrupt the focus is to challenge the systems that define and contain what it means to live with madness, to interrogate the stories that have been written about us rather than by us. Every artist featured is a disruptor. They move beyond acceptable narratives of resilience and recovery to confront the intersectionality of lived experience.",

The terrifying monster from the movie Jaws is what many might imagine when they think of these animals, but they are far more fascinating and complex than their depiction in popular culture.\n\nThis exhibition invites you to uncover fresh perspectives, groundbreaking research, and the astounding diversity of this ancient group of fishes.\n\nVisitors will delve into the anatomy, behaviour, and history of sharks, from familiar favourites like tiger sharks and great whites to lesser-known species like the dwarf lanternshark—a tiny, light-producing marvel small enough to hold in your hand.",

Interactive components invite viewers to design digital carpets, while immersive soundscapes trace over diasporic histories. Everyday objects such as rugs and combs are recontextualized to expose colonial legacies and their ongoing relevance.  \n\nEach artist approaches the Museum's collection as both catalyst and collaborator, translating these literal threads of memory, identity, and material culture into digital form. The Museum is embracing a new era of textile art, where the fabrics our collection transform into digital responses.",

This series began in 2015 and was partially inspired by a famous photograph of British painter Francis Bacon in his studio. Dimtri developed his approach through a series of portraits he shot during the pandemic of local small business owners in their shops.\n\n\"To celebrate the opening of this new space nothing could be more appropriate than sharing a selection of Dimitri Levanoff's photographs of Toronto artists, the lifeblood of the poetic heartbeat of our city.\", says Matthew Jocelyn, General Director of Koffler Arts.",

    "description": "Recent events have encouraged Canadians to reflect on the significance of our country. When we think of the places, people, and events that have shaped our collective memory, photographs often come to mind. In support of this reflection and to inspire deeper appreciation, we present a selection of works that highlight the evolution of photography over the past seventy-five years and its important role in documenting history.\n\nThis exhibition primarily features photographs taken in Canada. Organized chronologically, the exhibition includes original examples by photographers who exhibited in camera club salons during the 1950s and 1960s, and explores the continuing influence of documentary practice from that period to the present. It also traces the rise of photography accepted as art, and its growing prominence.",

Many of his animations are joined by music drawn from the Ukrainian Art Song Project which runs through software to produce the accompanying audio.",

    "description": "A fresh and unique sound which combines a beautiful and original mix of Ukrainian, Balkan, Iraqi Middle-Eastern and French Celtic music. \n\nThe project was initiated by Tangi Ropars when he met newcomers Yura, from Ukraine, and Ahmed, from Iraq.  In June 2016, during a gathering in Northern Ontario, they met every day in the woods to share and teach each other their respective melodies and rhythms. As they were playing, the rural Ontario mosquitos, were joyfully feasting on the multicultural group inspiring their eponymous name. \n\nAlmost two years later, the trio connected with the notable violin player, Fethi Nadjem freshly landed for Algeria, adding his oriental flavour to the sound mix.\n\nMore than the music, despite their diverse traditions, political and social stories, they share a deeper connection, a mutual love and respect for each other and a common desire to spread messages of unity.",

The journalist had grown up hearing stories about her father's near-starvation and ultimate survival in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but she never imagined she would be able to face this epic legacy head on.\n\nThen a chance encounter with a perfect bowl of borscht in Warsaw set Bonny on a journey to unearth her culinary lineage, and she began to dig for the roots of her food obsession, dish by dish. \"How to Share an Egg\" is a journey of deep flavors and surprising contrasts.",

The idea was to bring traditional Indian music to a global audience in a way that can be presented in performance venues and environments available to us today.\n\nGandhaar has since released multiple EPs and singles, polishing the unique sound that he discovered through this blending of distinctly different worlds. He has been performing this music as a solo performer and with a band for about a decade. Since moving to Toronto a year ago, he teamed up with tabla player and drummer Dhaivat Jani, who fit right in and was the perfect partner to play this music live with.",

Along with a pop-up panel highlighting these women, Scarborough Museum will be hosting a conversation with author and local historian, Barbara Dickson, as she discusses her book \"Bomb Girls: Trading Aprons for Ammo\" by the fireside, followed by a book signing. \n\nChallenging common gender narratives regarding war efforts, Dickson traces the lives of these women and their dangerous work at Canada's largest fuse filling munitions factory. Ranging in age from 17 to 70, they included newcomers from countries like Nigeria, Greece, China, and Syria. If you love what you learn, limited copies will be available for purchase.\n\nAs part of the Community Memories project the City of Toronto Collections and Archives team will be part of this event. If you have family photo you'd like to preserve, they will scan and digitize it for free!\n\nTreats and refreshments will be available on a first come-first served basis, while quantities last.",

Iconic hits like \"My Way,\" \"Come Fly with Me,\" and \"Fly Me to the Moon\" have become enduring classics, shaping the soundscape of early pop, swing, and jazz.\n\nBorn to Italian immigrants, Sinatra's remarkable 'rags to riches' journey embodies the vitality and artistic spirit of Italian culture in post-World War II America. His voice, charisma, and influence continue to resonate across generations.\n\nJoin us for an unforgettable evening featuring acclaimed jazz vocalist John Alcorn and The Daniel Barnes Trio, as they revisit the timeless songs of \"The Voice\" and pay tribute to one of the most iconic Italo-American artists of the twentieth century.",

These faces, from musicians and actors to athletes, storytellers, and changemakers, reflect the heart of Canada's creative spirit.\n\nThrough bold colour, expression, and playfulness, she aims to capture not just likeness but essence,that spark that made each of these figures unforgettable.\n\nCanadians in the Round brings together 50 portraits, each a window into our shared stories. It's a joyful tribute to the people who've made us laugh, cry, sing, dream and smile.",

These threads are woven into something distinctly their own, literary and lived-in, music that asks for your attention and gives back more the deeper you listen.",

    "description": "Relive the moments that have made Toronto's Santa Claus Parade a beloved celebration for more than 120 years. From its humble beginnings in 1905 — when a single float carried Santa from Union Station to Eaton's — to the dazzling televised spectacle it is today, the parade has brought generations joy, hope and imagination. \n\nWhether you grew up watching from the curb or tuning in from home, this nostalgic exhibition invites you to experience the enduring magic of Toronto's most treasured holiday event through striking images from the City of Toronto Archives, captured by photographers John H. Boyd, Harvey R. Naylor, Dorothy Skinner, Paul Till and Avard Woolaver.",

She asks intently if you have ever danced into your own abyss, and she invites you in.",

The work specializes in themes regarding feminism, social change, humour, pop culture, politics and romance.

Visitors can enjoy the opulent holiday décor and period ambiance that once filled the home of the wealthy Austin family. Twinkling lights, antique ornaments, and rooms set for a classic Jazz Age celebration bring the spirit of the season to life. \n\nAs you stroll through the mansion, interpretive displays offer insights into the lavish holiday traditions of Toronto's elite in the 1920s. In contrast, visitors will also learn about the experiences of the city's less fortunate citizens during the same era—those who faced poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity during a time of great social and economic change.\n\nFrom a grand dining room prepared for a festive feast to modest depictions of how the servants of the household marked the holidays, the experience paints a full picture of a Toronto Christmas in the early 20th century.",

This powerful documentary shows how fear, prejudice, and silence can transform communities. Using interviews and hand-drawn animation, the film explores how the Holocaust unfolded in the streets and homes of ordinary towns.",

Established in 2022, Love Hurts has been breathing new life into bonafide country classics and forgotten gems, pinning heart wrenching 50s balladry alongside 70s outlaw swagger, and 90s honky-tonk revival with swooning 60s countrypolitan. From Patsy Cline to Linda Ronstadt, George Jones to George Strait, Love Hurts makes the cream of the country music songbook sound as fresh as the day it was made.\n\nFronted by two dynamic singers, Barbara Johnston and Lowell Sostomi, and back by a cracking band who eat country licks for breakfast, Love Hurts follows no guide but a great song: if the tune makes you weep, call your momma, drink 15 beers, or cuss out your ex, you just might hear it at Love Hurts' next gig.",

    "description": "One of Toronto's oldest holiday traditions. \n\nFirst staged here in 1938, this pageant began in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in London, England in 1928. Queen Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were taken to see it when they were little girls. The story of the Nativity is told through a series of narrated scenes linked by beautiful organ music and carols from an unseen choir.   \n\nClose to 50 volunteers, including babies who take turns playing the role of baby Jesus, perform in the cast. The Church of the Holy Trinity, a 178-year-old architectural treasure, brings its own charm to the show.  ASL interpretation is available on Friday, December 19th.",

Come see what Andy's auntie called \"a real Laurel and Hardy vibe\".\n\nClown duo Glen and Vinny got their start as grips on The Johnny Carson show, and after sleeping their way to the middle, booked a Disney Cruise and are thrilled to be making their Second City debut.",

Her personal history is threaded with the global upheavals of World War II, revealed through the parallel wartime journeys of her two sets of grandparents.

In contrast, her non-Jewish paternal grandmother, Wandeczka, fought social norms in Kabul, to become the first woman allowed to buy groceries in her local Afghan market. Caroline will conclude by sharing the compelling journey that led her to work at an underground school for girls in Afghanistan.",

From Nubia, Sudan, to Harlem and Toronto.\n\nTheir rhythms are played in what is considered \"odd time\" in Western music, combining jazz chord progressions with traditional African rhythms to produce an entrancing experience.\n\nWaleed tells stories atop an imaginative musical landscape, inspired by the chanting and vocal phrasing which have accompanied these rhythms since ancient times. Each composition narrates an experience or journey, continually changing depending on what story the musicians want to tell. \n\nSometimes these experiences are personal, sometimes they are historical, sometimes they are a retelling of the past of the Nile and Nubian pyramids. Each musical journey creates a relationship between the band and the audience. Waleed sings in over 15 African and Western languages, celebrating the African diaspora in Canada.",

He has supported comedy superstar Michael McIntyre on his worldwide tour and appeared on Live At The Apollo, Comedy Central, and Dave.\n\nAs a writer, Jake has contributed to many of the UK's top comedy shows, including The Royal Variety Performance, Michael McIntyre's Big Show, Bake Off, and 8 Out of 10 Cats.

The band is a powerhouse that can improvise and turn tunes around on a dime to create unique frenzied moments that leave audiences awestruck and excited. \n\nThe Woodshed Orchestra can play out as an electric band with drums, guitars, horns, keyboards and vocals and just as easily break out into a New Orleans-type 2nd Line brass band on parade.

    "description": "Shakespeare said, \"Brevity is the soul of wit\".\n\nWe took that to heart, then added music. Audiences have called The One Liner Show \"fun,\" \"innovative,\" and \"one of a kind\".\n\nThis edition features headliner Todd Graham and a carefully curated lineup of comedians, each with 4 minutes to deliver their sharpest short jokes, backed by a live jazz musician. No stories. No crowd work. No filler.\n\nThis isn't your typical stand-up show. It's a hybrid of stand-up and improvised jazz, a live collision of jokes and music. \n\nCreated by and for those who love the art of the short joke, this show is presented by comedians Stephen Paylor and Eric Pillwein to carry on the spirit of the late, great Mitch Hedberg.",

Through delicate, small and medium scale works, artist JJ Lee explores how personal and collective narratives, shaped by migration and colonization, are mediated through drawing, adding a fragile and ephemeral quality. Yesterday Reframed centers drawing as both a physical and conceptual practice; an act of tracing, reconstructing and remembering. Through this exhibit, Lee reflects on how histories are passed down, lost and reassembled across generations, using materiality and process to make visible what is often unseen.",

The New York Times says that \"Montero's playing had everything: crackling rhythmic brio, subtle shadings, steely power … soulful lyricism … unsentimental expressivity\". Celebrated for her exceptional musicality and ability to improvise, Montero is a frequent recitalist and chamber musician, having performed at such distinguished venues as Wigmore Hall, Carnegie Hall, Vienna Konzerthaus, Sydney Opera House, and the National Concert Hall in Taipei.",

But in this darkness, Tauba's unbreakable spirit becomes a beacon. While her parents slip deeper into despair, Tauba refuses to surrender to fear.  Against all odds, Tauba sustains her will to survive, holding onto hope until the liberation of Paris, when she can finally reclaim her life and her future.  \n\nCome together to reflect on the heroic actions of Raoul Wallenberg and engage in a story of strength and resilience. \n\nMovie is in French, with English subtitles.",

These are two visionary artists whose work explores the intersections of identity, heritage, memory, and the human body. \n\nIn Wayqeycuna, Tiziano Cruz draws from archival research and personal history and reflects on how racial hierarchies and systems of domination persist in a world reshaped by neoliberalism's erasure of cultural and collective identities.\n\nIn Mark of a Woman, the personal histories and tattooing culture is explored and celebrated.\n\nAudiences to experience the world through radically different perspectives, each one redefining how we connect across cultures, languages, and lived experience.",

    "description": "Presenting our first-ever concert dedicated entirely to film music, an exciting addition to our season! \n\nThis cinematic program highlights two landmark scores that transformed the role of orchestral music in film. \n\nNino Rota's music for The Godfather draws on Sicilian folk traditions and classical forms to deepen the film's exploration of family, legacy, and moral ambiguity. John Williams's Star Wars score channels the grandeur of late-Romantic composers like Wagner and Holst, using recurring musical themes to represent characters, places, and ideas across the saga. \n\nTogether, these works reveal how orchestral soundtracks have shaped the emotional and narrative landscape of modern cinema.",

    "description": "Join us for a beginner-friendly winter tour at Falstaff Park, focused on the basics of identifying trees in winter. We'll explore features like bark, branch pattern, and overall shape, helping you build confidence in winter ID. You'll also learn how these trees fit into the broader ecology of Toronto's urban forest. This relaxed walk is perfect for anyone new to tree identification or curious about how much the winter landscape can reveal once you know what to look for.\n \nThis tour will have both inside and outside components. Dress according to the weather to stay warm and prepare for uneven and slippery terrain. Tour distances will range from 1– 5 km.\n \nSpace is limited. Please register in advance at greentoronto@toronto.ca. Include the name of the tour you would like to attend and the number of attendees.\n \nContact greentoronto@toronto.ca for information on site conditions, and accessibility. If you would like to request accessibility support, contact us as soon as possible.",

But soon she faces a far greater horror, Krishna has been trafficked to Delhi. \n\nDriven by primal, maternal love, she embarks on a gut-wrenching journey through the underbelly of a broken system, where every lead is a gamble and every choice is impossible. \n\n\"Through the Eyes of God\" is a piercingly emotional and sharply critical journey that asks, how far will a mother go to protect her child?",

Using paint, plaster, paper, and fabric, she explores organic forms, heritage, and resilience - layers that feel both physical and emotional. Craig, on the other hand, investigates natural processes through paint itself, guiding flow, sediment, and movement to create what he calls \"paintscapes,\" where beauty emerges through interaction, change, and time.\n\nTogether, their practice becomes a shared exploration, an open, curious process where two creative voices converge to create something cohesive, balanced, and deeply resonant. What you see on the walls tonight is the result of trust, experimentation, and a genuine dialogue between materials, nature and each other.",

    "description": "Toronto's alt-country and folk-rock legends make their long-awaited return.\n\nFormed in Toronto in 1985 by Margo Timmins (vocalist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer), and Alan Anton (bassist). The Junkies first performed publicly at the Beverley Tavern and other clubs in Toronto's Queen Street West, including The Rivoli. \n\nTheir 1986 debut album, produced by Canadian Peter Moore, was the blues-inspired \"Whites Off Earth Now!!\", recorded using an ambisonic microphone in the family garage.\n\nThe group's fame spread with their second album, \"The Trinity Session\", recorded in 1987 at Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity. Their sound, again using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of blues, country, folk, rock, and jazz earned them both critical attention and a cult following.\n\nAfter the concert, enjoy a beverage and more music.",

From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the \"imagined touch\" of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.",

We'll explore features like bark, branch pattern and shape, helping you build confidence in winter ID. You'll also learn how these trees fit into the broader ecology of Toronto's urban forest. This relaxed walk is perfect for those new to tree identification or curious about how much the winter landscape can reveal once you know what to look for.\n\nThis tour will have both inside and outside components. Please dress according to the weather to stay warm and prepare for uneven and slippery terrain. Tour distances will range from 1 – 5 km. \n\nSpace is limited.

Materials speak shaping a dialogue that extends beyond the artists where paint, surface and light respond becoming a unique voice in the conversation. From translucent layers to reactive surfaces, gestural marks to shifting reflections, the artists find common ground in the physicality of making. \n\nUnified by process-driven approaches, the works span painting, mixed media, and reactive surface treatments. The exhibition explores themes of emotional resonance, memory and material transformation. Light, reflection and surface tension play vital roles in shaping the viewer's experience drawing attention to what lies beneath and beyond.

    "description": "In this duo show, both painters present their perspective on Canadian landscape painting. \n\nPetra Eperjesi distils familiar rural landscapes into their simplest shapes. Using hard edges her acrylic painting are rendered in vibrant colours with a playful/wonky perspective. The colours are unconventional and her perspective is often isometric, resulting in a contemporary, surreal landscape. \n\nDavid Lidbetter's approach which is softer, observationally traditional, a modern interpretation of the Group of Seven.  Lidbetter's paintings have an emotional content. The feeling of isolation, solitude and quiet pervade his works. \n\nWhile the two styles are radically different, the common denominator is still a vast unmistakable, unyielding Canadian landscape. We invite the viewer to delve into the contrasting interpretations of landscape painting presented by these two amazing artists.",

Enjoy his program of Gabriel Fauré: Ballade in F-sharp major, Op. 19, Claude Debussy: Ballade, Johannes Brahms: Ballades, Op. 10 (Complete) and Franz Liszt: Ballade.",

There are native species of these fruits found in Toronto's ravines too!  Join avid fruit gardener and City of Toronto Forestry staffer Steven Parkes for a webinar on Toronto's native and edible fruiting plants, their ecological importance and where you might spot them in our urban wilderness. You'll learn how adding these plants to your local landscapes and private gardens can enhance habitats, support local wildlife and pollinators, while producing native fruits and nuts. Please note: this is not a foraging webinar. The focus will be on integrating native edible plants into private gardens. Please snack responsibly.",

    "description": "Classical music and jazz collide as two of today's most prolific and compelling pianists join forces to create a unique program featuring jazz exploration, classical romanticism, and pop allure.\n\nGrammy Award-winning jazz pianist Brad Mehldau has recorded and performed extensively since the early 1990s. He is first and foremost an improviser and greatly cherishes the surprise and wonder that can occur from a spontaneous musical idea that is expressed directly, in real time. But he also has a deep fascination for the formal architecture of music, and it informs everything he plays. The two sides of Mehldau's personality – the improviser and the formalist – play off each other, and the effect is often something like controlled chaos. \n\nKirill Gerstein has established himself as one of today's most prolific and compelling performers.",

These moments, strange yet achingly familiar, mirror our own desire to hold on, like couples not wanting the last dance to end.\n\nHaunting and exhilarating, Play Dead captures the fragility, absurdity, and fleeting wonder of life lived on the edge of connection.\n\nLa Presse lauds the performance as \"Masterful fluidity, breathtaking…the circus of tomorrow\".",
