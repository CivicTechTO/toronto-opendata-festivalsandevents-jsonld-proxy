Maybe Linda Belcher of Bob's Burgers will be in a budget meeting with the real Walt Disney? Maybe Rocky Balboa will be roommates with Kermit the Frog?

A mirrored column inside creates the illusion of a vast, infinite field of silver orbs.\n\nThanks to the generosity of over 4,700 #InfinityAGO donors and the David Yuile & Mary Elizabeth Hodgson Fund, Kusama's work is now part of the AGO Collection.",

This exciting site-specific project by Yong will transform the museum's elevators as well as the North End Gallery into immersive art spaces. \n\nYong has developed a textile practice that reinterprets traditional quilt-making—a craft passed down to him by his mother, an avid quilt-maker. This practice, rooted in centuries-old cultural traditions, considers the interplay of colour, pattern, and geometry. His works, crafted from diverse materials and layered prints, balance harmony and tension, resulting in abstract compositions that are both gestural and hard-edged.\n\nExplore \"Blur\" and see how Yong's vibrant quilts reshape familiar spaces.",

Visible reminders of this day are symbolized by hanging red dresses in windows, on balconies or in trees. \n\nThis year at TMU, we are commemorating this day by having our second annual outdoor Red Dress Exhibit. The exhibit will be a visible reminder, bringing forth awareness of the targeted gendered and racialized crimes against the Indigenous Peoples. All community members are invited to visit and observe.",

    "description": "Originally Based on John Gay's 18th century ballad opera The Beggar's Opera, The Threepenny Opera has long excited audiences with its unfiltered, confrontational narrative as well as its social commentary. Written in 1928, Brecht's cutting satirical critique of capitalism takes us through Victorian London's Soho where we are plunged into the seedy underbelly of the Savoy Hotel, Grape Lane Brothel, and Peachum's Emporium for Beggars. Timely and prophetic, Brecht deftly blurs the lines between a hypocritical bourgeois society, with its wealthy, corrupt power brokers, and the criminal underworld of cut-throats, thieves and whores.",

    "description": "In Paris during the summer of 1778, Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges and a young Wolfgang Mozart lived within a block of one another, and yet scholars have no evidence that the two musicians ever met. Seven years later they each published a set of six quartets: Mozart's are well-known and much beloved, but the Bologne works are only recently rediscovered. \n\nLucky for music lovers, the Eybler Quartet has continued its exploration of the recently rediscovered Op. 14 string quartets of Joseph Bologne, pairing them with the revered quartets of Wolfgang Mozart dedicated to Haydn. This is a unique opportunity to experience one of Canada's best string quartets in an intimate and authentic setting.",

Its impact in Korea was felt acutely in the 18th century leading to dramatic changes in visual and material culture still felt today.\n\nThe presentation will be followed by Korean-inspired refreshments and a performance of Korean traditional music quartet Haneum.",

With a creative team that includes queer artists who are active and working in the Toronto BDSM and kink scene, this production brings a unique, respectful, and honest perspective as it pertains to Domination and Submission as a healing modality.\n\nIn Venus In Fur, a beleaguered, controlling playwright and first-time director is desperate to find the lead for his adaptation of the classic 1870 sadomasochistic tale by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Into his empty audition room storms an equally desperate actress—with connections to the material that seem to be too coincidental to be true.",

Join us and experience basketball history come to life through augmented reality, where you can custom design your own basketball jersey.\n\nEven before the Toronto Raptors and the rallying cry, \"We the North\" became a slogan, for over a century, basketball in Toronto was deeply rooted in the evolving social and cultural conditions of our city and its people.  \n\nFrom the Canadian invention of basketball to the early women's game in 1895, to the first professional basketball game played by the short-lived Toronto Huskies in 1946, and the recent creation of the Toronto Tempo WNBA team, these and many other milestones chart the sport's development in the city.",

This is a full day experience with gaming as performance; an immersive, cheeky and highly original work. Brave spectators take turns at the controller to lead the herd through a post-Industrial society, where asses are valued more for their hides than their potential.\n\nThis game is as if Animal Farm meets Pokémon meets Final Fantasy: as exciting in form as it is in content.

Set inside a building with real ties to Toronto's bootlegging past, this is no ordinary night out. It's the Roaring '20s, but with better booze. Expect handcrafted cocktails straight outta the 1920s, bites inspired by the golden age of grit and glamour, burlesque by Knox Harter, Smokin' Dolores and Aza Lia, sleight-of-hand by Chris Mayhew and swing, sass, and lots of opportunities for photos.",

    "description": "Dive into the Battle of York in which American invaders occupied the town of York during the War of 1812. Explore the reasons for the invasion, the state of York's defences, the course of the battle and why it ruined Elizabeth Powell's dinner party. We'll also take a look at what this area was like in 1813 and how the American occupation shaped the development of the future city of Toronto.\n\nThis 4.0 kilometre-long tour was developed and will be led by Adam Waiser. Adam is a history enthusiast and co-host of the Muddy York history podcast. The podcast has been operating for nearly two years and their mission is to tell Toronto stories and inform listeners about what the GTA was like before the year 2000.",

This is a new dance-work co-created and danced by Nancy Christie, directed by Kathleen Rea and dramaturgy work by Tristan R. Whiston, that explores the repeating circle of loss and love in the lives of women as mothers and caregivers and care receivers who are more than the sum of all these roles. It is a piece about aging and being ageless.",

He is a former member of Nu Guinea, Nuova Napoli Band and is involved and engaged in the Italian scene of radical improvisation. The compositions are inspired by the idea of natural biodiversity as an expression of contamination, coexistence and balance. Multiculturalism becomes coexistence.

The City of Toronto is developing a 10-year Circular Economy Road Map to tackle some of today's most urgent challenges — the growing landfill capacity issues, affordability and rising living costs, climate change, and the clear need for more resilient, local systems. The term \"circular economy\" refers to a society-wide approach to production and consumption that aims to eliminate landfill waste and maximize resources by recovering as much as possible. It is a system where everything we use – from buildings and food, to clothing and electronics – never becomes waste. Instead, they remain in circulation through processes like redesign, reduction, reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling, and recovery.",

    "description": "At Kids Rock For Kids we believe the impact of forging worldwide bonds among the next generation to be profound, and necessary in the pursuit of a global citizenry that strives toward a common, peaceful future. We can think of no better way to forge those bonds than through music.  The shared experience of using that music to help others heightens the strength of those bonds and reinforces the resolve in our young performers that they can make a difference. Because we seek out young musicians of truly exceptional talent, who are often already committed to careers in music, we expect that more than a few future stars will have grown up in our community — and that the philanthropic instinct we help to nurture now will benefit the world later.",

Gonia has created a new style of K-jazz based on traditional rhythms on the janggu, hourglass-shaped, double headed drum, with smooth and progressive guitar and bass licks with sophisticated melodies. Their music features different traditional rhythms - the breath of the gutgeori, the joy of jajinmori, and the dynamism that comes from whimori are all harmonized with improvisation and the beauty of jazz to create Gonia's unique sound!",

Live music, dancing, and a costume parade fill out the day's activities. Shop for unique products, prepared food, and drinks from diverse local vendors. You may also pack your own picnic. \nSpadina's annual event is inspired by a garden party organized by Mary Austin in support of the Women's Art Association of Canada in 1928. This year's event celebrates the theme of Home.\nWear your best historical 1920's dress from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds.",

Transcending the tactile sensations felt at the fingertips, shokkan is the combination of memories, language, and other senses like sight and sound. \n\nThis exhibition showcases over 100 objects. From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the \"imagined touch\" of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.",
