    "description": "Bad Indians Book Club, by Anishinaabe and Ukrainian writer Patty Krawec, is a bold exploration of Indigenous literature and the stories that challenge colonial narratives. Emerging from a year-long reading journey, Krawec blends memoir, cultural critique, and storytelling to examine works by marginalized voices and their power to reshape identity and belonging. Interwoven with the figure of Deer Woman, this book invites readers to the edges of worlds waiting to be born. Praised with a Booklist starred review, it offers a potent call to rethink the stories we inherit.\n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni. Each in-person event features readings, discussions, Q&A, book signings and ASL interpretation, while virtual sessions include live subtitles and audio access.",

The form is remarkably flexible, so while the genre remains consistent, the emotional depth and variety of the compositions, as well as Lortie's performance, will make for fascinating and a deeply satisfying evening.\n\nLouis Lortie has earned an extraordinary international reputation as both a recitalist and a soloist with orchestras worldwide. Enjoy his program of Gabriel Fauré: Ballade in F-sharp major, Op. 19, Claude Debussy: Ballade, Johannes Brahms: Ballades, Op. 10 (Complete) and Franz Liszt: Ballade.",

He is first and foremost an improviser and greatly cherishes the surprise and wonder that can occur from a spontaneous musical idea that is expressed directly, in real time. But he also has a deep fascination for the formal architecture of music, and it informs everything he plays. The two sides of Mehldau's personality – the improviser and the formalist – play off each other, and the effect is often something like controlled chaos. \n\nKirill Gerstein has established himself as one of today's most prolific and compelling performers.",

This exhibition adds yet another voice to the developing story and renewed global interest surrounding questions of race and immigration witnessed in society recently. \n\nAbout the Artist \nJim Bravo was born in Ecuador, South America, and is of Afro-Latino and Quichua descent. He emigrated to Toronto Canada with his family in the mid 70s and spent his youth in the downtown central west and east core of the city. He is a graduate of The Ontario College of Art and Design University where he majored in Fine Art and public monumental painting. A multi award winning painter including first honor for the prestigious 2023 Kingston Prize For Contemporary Canadian Portraiture, Bravo is also the recipient of grants from Toronto Art Council, Ontario Arts Council grants and TABIA Mural Award.",

    "description": "Play Dead invites you into a distorted world where the familiar twists into something wonderful and strange. Everyday rituals warp into surreal scenes, exposing the desperation that underpins our search for connection. In this gravity-defying universe, bodies collide and tangle, caught between beauty and menace — both intimate and unsettling.\n\nMontreal's People Watching crafts a vivid blend of acrobatics, movement, and high octane circus that magnifies the absurdity of the everyday. These moments, strange yet achingly familiar, mirror our own desire to hold on, like couples not wanting the last dance to end.\n\nHaunting and exhilarating, Play Dead captures the fragility, absurdity, and fleeting wonder of life lived on the edge of connection.\n\nLa Presse lauds the performance as \"Masterful fluidity, breathtaking…the circus of tomorrow\".",
