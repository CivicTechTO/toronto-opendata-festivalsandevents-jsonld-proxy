    "description": "This groundbreaking ROM-original exhibition explores the profound connection between Japanese objects and the human sense of touch, known as shokkan—a vital element in the creation and appreciation of Japanese art. Transcending the tactile sensations felt at the fingertips, shokkan is the combination of memories, language, and other senses like sight and sound. \n\nThis exhibition showcases over 100 objects. From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the \"imagined touch\" of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.",

Materials speak shaping a dialogue that extends beyond the artists where paint, surface and light respond becoming a unique voice in the conversation.

The exhibition explores themes of emotional resonance, memory and material transformation. Light, reflection and surface tension play vital roles in shaping the viewer's experience drawing attention to what lies beneath and beyond.

    "description": "In this duo show, both painters present their perspective on Canadian landscape painting. \n\nPetra Eperjesi distils familiar rural landscapes into their simplest shapes. Using hard edges her acrylic painting are rendered in vibrant colours with a playful/wonky perspective. The colours are unconventional and her perspective is often isometric, resulting in a contemporary, surreal landscape. \n\nDavid Lidbetter's approach which is softer, observationally traditional, a modern interpretation of the Group of Seven.  Lidbetter's paintings have an emotional content. The feeling of isolation, solitude and quiet pervade his works. \n\nWhile the two styles are radically different, the common denominator is still a vast unmistakable, unyielding Canadian landscape. We invite the viewer to delve into the contrasting interpretations of landscape painting presented by these two amazing artists.",

Enjoy his program of Gabriel Fauré: Ballade in F-sharp major, Op. 19, Claude Debussy: Ballade, Johannes Brahms: Ballades, Op. 10 (Complete) and Franz Liszt: Ballade.",

    "description": "Classical music and jazz collide as two of today's most prolific and compelling pianists join forces to create a unique program featuring jazz exploration, classical romanticism, and pop allure.\n\nGrammy Award-winning jazz pianist Brad Mehldau has recorded and performed extensively since the early 1990s. He is first and foremost an improviser and greatly cherishes the surprise and wonder that can occur from a spontaneous musical idea that is expressed directly, in real time. But he also has a deep fascination for the formal architecture of music, and it informs everything he plays. The two sides of Mehldau's personality – the improviser and the formalist – play off each other, and the effect is often something like controlled chaos. \n\nKirill Gerstein has established himself as one of today's most prolific and compelling performers.",
