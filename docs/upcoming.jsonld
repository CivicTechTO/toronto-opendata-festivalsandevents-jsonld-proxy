Before he was revered and canonized, Shakespeare's plays were raucous, irreverent and relevant. When first staged in 1596, Romeo and Juliet referenced contemporary politics and the eternal human condition. \n\nThis summer, whether you're in Verona or Toronto, one thing is certain - the day is hot, the Capulets abroad.",
