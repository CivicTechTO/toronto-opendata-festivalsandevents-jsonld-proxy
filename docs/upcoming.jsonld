These extraordinary painters found new ways to depict reality, portray humanity, and tell stories that created parallels to their world then - and to our world today. \n\nThis large-scale exhibition, featuring over 80 stunning art works and objects — medieval, Renaissance, and baroque paintings, sculptures and more — offers a doorway into the Southern Netherlands of 1400 to 1700. The exhibition's unique presentation introduces the visitor, through these rare, extraordinary artworks, to stories of enterprising townspeople, prosperous cities, and an ever-developing society.",

    "description": "Beginning July 1st at Scarborough Museum, experience Washed Up by Hatecopy. The project captures the essence of liminal spaces that serve as cultural hubs for the South Asian immigrant communities, using the washing machine as a vessel to carry textiles that signify our roots and drawing visitors into an environment that intertwines the past, present, and future; acknowledging the dirty laundry of Canadian History and \"Truth,\" and reclaiming both seen and unseen spaces.\n\nMaria Qamar (b. 1991) is a Toronto-based pop artist whose work is focused in the South Asian diaspora and immigrant communities and their cultural experiences. The work specializes in themes regarding feminism, social change, humour, pop culture, politics and romance. The artist has been recognized both nationally and internationally with exhibits and features in the Museum of Contemporary Arts, the National Arts Centre, Sotheby's, Phillips Auction, and the AGO.",

We can think of no better way to forge those bonds than through music.  The shared experience of using that music to help others heightens the strength of those bonds and reinforces the resolve in our young performers that they can make a difference. Because we seek out young musicians of truly exceptional talent, who are often already committed to careers in music, we expect that more than a few future stars will have grown up in our community — and that the philanthropic instinct we help to nurture now will benefit the world later.",

From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the \"imagined touch\" of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.",
