    "description": "This groundbreaking ROM-original exhibition explores the profound connection between Japanese objects and the human sense of touch, known as shokkan—a vital element in the creation and appreciation of Japanese art. Transcending the tactile sensations felt at the fingertips, shokkan is the combination of memories, language, and other senses like sight and sound. \n\nThis exhibition showcases over 100 objects. From the intricate texture of a matcha tea bowl to the \"imagined touch\" of a woodblock print, be inspired by the exquisite and innovative craftsmanship through encounters with touchable objects and hands-on experiences that allow you to fully appreciate Japanese art.",
