The shared experience of using that music to help others heightens the strength of those bonds and reinforces the resolve in our young performers that they can make a difference. Because we seek out young musicians of truly exceptional talent, who are often already committed to careers in music, we expect that more than a few future stars will have grown up in our community — and that the philanthropic instinct we help to nurture now will benefit the world later.",

Before he was revered and canonized, Shakespeare's plays were raucous, irreverent and relevant. When first staged in 1596, Romeo and Juliet referenced contemporary politics and the eternal human condition. \n\nThis summer, whether you're in Verona or Toronto, one thing is certain - the day is hot, the Capulets abroad.",
