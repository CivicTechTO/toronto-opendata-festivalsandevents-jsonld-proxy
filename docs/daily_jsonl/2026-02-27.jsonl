All the leading ladies of the Daisy ensemble battle for the role of Juliet, including faded diva Esme Massengill in a boozy interpretation of the lovesick ingénue. Beloved audience favourites Schnitzel and Mrs. Edna Rural are back in supporting roles, and adding to the fun and mayhem, The Bard himself joins The Daisy Theatre cast for a twisted retelling of this tragic romance... with strings attached. \n\nLittle Willy is intended for audience members, ages 16 and up.", "url": "https://my.canadianstage.com/overview/9388", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/R2kL2PPTmJn1M7ubOUK7GA", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Canadian Stage", "email": "boxoffice@canadianstage.com", "telephone": "4163683110"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Live Performances", "Theatre"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "50.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://my.canadianstage.com/overview/9388"}}
