Many of his animations are joined by music drawn from the Ukrainian Art Song Project which runs through software to produce the accompanying audio.", "url": "https://www.shevchenko.ca/events/details.cfm?eventid=2172", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/gVlRHYEvAZ8o4pdCDMTWSw", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "shevchenkomuseum@bellnet.ca", "telephone": "4165348662"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Cultural", "Museum"]}
