Through a mix of 16mm film, digital animation, hand-processing, 3D scanning, and archival translations, Sanzgiri continues his research into the life of Angolan revolutionary Sita Valles, and the bonds of solidarity that developed between India and Africa against the Portuguese empire. Shot throughout Angola, Goa, and Portugal, the film was conceived as a letter to Valles on the pressing issues of disappearance, loss, and the revolutionary struggles of our time.", "url": "https://www.mercerunion.org/exhibitions/sanzgiri-an-impossible-address", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/2_Suneil Sanzgiri_An Impossible Address_NeUfC8pJs6u0dU1_U5AQLA.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Ines Min PR", "email": "jennifer@inesmin.com", "telephone": "5879667318"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "History"]}
