Inspired by the real-life daughter of Miguel de Cervantes, the book follows fifteen-year-old Isabel as she navigates secrecy, love, and survival in a patriarchal world while her father works on Don Quixote. Through richly detailed prose, Bátiz gives voice to the women who lived in the shadows of history, blending drama, resilience and untold stories.\n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni.
