It's a nod to global (or even galactic) unity, and to the idea that despite all the noise and division, we're more alike than not. \n\nIn her Canadian debut, Intergalactic Planetary brings together imagery and works inspired by cities including Shanghai, Chongqing, Berlin, Tokyo, Bangkok and locations across the United States. Snelling explains, \"Through this work, I ask: how can we move beyond our fears, borders, and egos to become more humane? Perhaps by staying curious, open, and willing to see each other more fully, we can take a small step toward connection, and even a glimmer of peace for the future\".\n\nJoin us on Nuit Blanche to view the exhibition's works, while DJ beats set the mood with dynamic sounds and enjoy two exhibition-inspired cocktails-one coffee-based and the other with an intergalactic twist.", "url": "https://www.kofflerarts.org/whatson/exhibitions/exhibition/intergalactic-planetary-tracey-snelling", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/z-qgSLb2djwAwYiH36xNGg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Koffler Arts", "email": "admin@kofflerarts.org", "telephone": "6479250643"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Cultural"]}
