Despite her callous management style, the cooks learn to reclaim their lives, find purpose, and become inspired to dream by their shared quest to create the perfect sandwich. A buoyant play full of witty dialogue, Clyde's is a transcendent story about second chances, rising above past mistakes, and reconnecting with the world.  \n\nFull of sizzling wit, big heart, and mouthwatering ambition, Clyde's serves up a thrilling, high-energy ride—think The Bear meets Broadway. Helmed by returning director Philip Akin (The Lehman Trilogy, Fat Ham), an all-star Canadian cast takes on this deliciously funny and deeply moving play.", "url": "https://my.canadianstage.com/overview/9459", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/rdQQ2Pue2t77BA8vbhqUqQ", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "boxoffice@canadianstage.com", "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Live Performances", "Theatre"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "50.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://my.canadianstage.com/overview/9459"}}
