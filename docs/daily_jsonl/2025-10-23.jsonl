Using art as the entry point to illuminate and investigate the realities and mythologies surrounding mental illness and addiction, we are spotlighting the human capacity for endurance in the face of great challenges. \n\nThe theme this year is \"Disrupt the Focus\", a statement that questions which narratives are emphasized, and which are silenced. \n\nThis is a platform for artists, whose lived experience expands our understanding of living with mental health and addiction. To disrupt the focus is to challenge the systems that define and contain what it means to live with madness, to interrogate the stories that have been written about us rather than by us. Every artist featured is a disruptor. They move beyond acceptable narratives of resilience and recovery to confront the intersectionality of lived experience.", "url": "https://workmanarts.com/rendezvous-with-madness/", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/NuLheDeBaiqe26h3J861fw", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Workman Arts", "email": null, "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Film", "Live Performances"]}
