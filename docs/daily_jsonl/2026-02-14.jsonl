Souls will ignite.\n\nSurrounded by heavy-hitters from Quebec's indie scene (Colectivo, Grimskunk, Funkafones), Johnny Shango cranks out a sound that channels the explosive energy of James Brown, the swagger of Lenny Kravitz, and the spirit of an endless funk party.", "url": "https://www.dromtaberna.com", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/woQrexW6FOPbyMLIygTCXw", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": null, "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Live Performances", "Music", "Nightlife"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "15.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD"}}
