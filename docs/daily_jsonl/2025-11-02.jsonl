Stories of loss and resilience, displacement and belonging, pain and hope are a shared narrative and experience.\n\nTogether, these quilts form a shared tapestry, a collective voice rising from women's hearts, creating beauty and solidarity through the art of textile making.", "url": "toronto.ca/gibsonhouse", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/bP6HeHUawZ3osDie1E5J3A", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "gibsonhouse@toronto.ca", "telephone": "4163957432"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Museum"]}
