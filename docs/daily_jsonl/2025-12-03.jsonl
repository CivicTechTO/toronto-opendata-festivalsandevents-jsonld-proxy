In contrast, visitors will also learn about the experiences of the city's less fortunate citizens during the same era—those who faced poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity during a time of great social and economic change.\n\nFrom a grand dining room prepared for a festive feast to modest depictions of how the servants of the household marked the holidays, the experience paints a full picture of a Toronto Christmas in the early 20th century.", "url": "https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/spadina-museum/", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/jzugXbqsMU5jldg0v0rFPg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "spadina@toronto.ca", "telephone": "416-392-6910"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Celebrations", "Museum"]}
