The form is remarkably flexible, so while the genre remains consistent, the emotional depth and variety of the compositions, as well as Lortie's performance, will make for fascinating and a deeply satisfying evening.\n\nLouis Lortie has earned an extraordinary international reputation as both a recitalist and a soloist with orchestras worldwide. Enjoy his program of Gabriel Fauré: Ballade in F-sharp major, Op. 19, Claude Debussy: Ballade, Johannes Brahms: Ballades, Op. 10 (Complete) and Franz Liszt: Ballade.", "url": "https://musictorontoconcerts.com/concerts/louis-lorte", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/fb0PvqJBwwSKwoeCuNdAKQ", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Music TORONTO", "email": "marketing@music-toronto.com", "telephone": "4163667723"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Cultural", "Live Performances", "Music"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "60.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://musictorontoconcerts.com/concerts/louis-lorte"}}
