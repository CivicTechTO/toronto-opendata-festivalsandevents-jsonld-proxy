Through delicate, small and medium scale works, artist JJ Lee explores how personal and collective narratives, shaped by migration and colonization, are mediated through drawing, adding a fragile and ephemeral quality. Yesterday Reframed centers drawing as both a physical and conceptual practice; an act of tracing, reconstructing and remembering. Through this exhibit, Lee reflects on how histories are passed down, lost and reassembled across generations, using materiality and process to make visible what is often unseen.", "url": "https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/cultural-centres-galleries/cedar-ridge-creative-centre/", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/KXJJeXdQKOgYaIboEM9jOw", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "crcc@toronto.ca", "telephone": "4163964026"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Artisan", "Cultural"]}
