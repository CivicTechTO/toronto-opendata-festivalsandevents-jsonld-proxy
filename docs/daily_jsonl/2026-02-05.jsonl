Using paint, plaster, paper, and fabric, she explores organic forms, heritage, and resilience - layers that feel both physical and emotional. Craig, on the other hand, investigates natural processes through paint itself, guiding flow, sediment, and movement to create what he calls \"paintscapes,\" where beauty emerges through interaction, change, and time.\n\nTogether, their practice becomes a shared exploration, an open, curious process where two creative voices converge to create something cohesive, balanced, and deeply resonant. What you see on the walls tonight is the result of trust, experimentation, and a genuine dialogue between materials, nature and each other.", "url": "https://riverdalehub.ca/gallery-event-registration/", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/TUjq-yQt9YNlEvNypz5aTQ", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "gallery@riverdalehub.ca", "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits"]}
