Materials speak shaping a dialogue that extends beyond the artists where paint, surface and light respond becoming a unique voice in the conversation. From translucent layers to reactive surfaces, gestural marks to shifting reflections, the artists find common ground in the physicality of making. \n\nUnified by process-driven approaches, the works span painting, mixed media, and reactive surface treatments. The exhibition explores themes of emotional resonance, memory and material transformation. Light, reflection and surface tension play vital roles in shaping the viewer's experience drawing attention to what lies beneath and beyond. Featured artists are Christie Baker, David Adshade and Sue Mackay.", "url": "www.davidadshade.com", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/_5Qvi9cda8LVFoamETBH0A", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": "assembly@toronto.ca", "telephone": "4163381516"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Artisan"]}
