He is first and foremost an improviser and greatly cherishes the surprise and wonder that can occur from a spontaneous musical idea that is expressed directly, in real time. But he also has a deep fascination for the formal architecture of music, and it informs everything he plays. The two sides of Mehldau's personality – the improviser and the formalist – play off each other, and the effect is often something like controlled chaos. \n\nKirill Gerstein has established himself as one of today's most prolific and compelling performers.", "url": "https://www.rcmusic.com/Tickets/Seats/401601", "image": null, "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Royal Conservatory of Music", "email": null, "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Live Performances", "Music"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "21.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://www.rcmusic.com/Tickets/Seats/401601"}}
