Emerging from a year-long reading journey, Krawec blends memoir, cultural critique, and storytelling to examine works by marginalized voices and their power to reshape identity and belonging. Interwoven with the figure of Deer Woman, this book invites readers to the edges of worlds waiting to be born. Praised with a Booklist starred review, it offers a potent call to rethink the stories we inherit.\n\nBy the Lake Book Club hosts six Tuesday-night events from February to December with top Canadian authors and Humber Polytechnics alumni. Each in-person event features readings, discussions, Q&A, book signings and ASL interpretation, while virtual sessions include live subtitles and audio access.", "url": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/feps_edc-ticketing/#events/7e366d7a-d820-4409-8355-cbc7f66f928e", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/B5CDNfI4VRvNFR7A8022mA", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "City of Toronto", "email": "assembly@toronto.ca", "telephone": "416-338-7255"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Literary"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "10.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/feps_edc-ticketing/#events/7e366d7a-d820-4409-8355-cbc7f66f928e"}}
