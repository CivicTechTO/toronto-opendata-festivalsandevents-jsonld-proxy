There are native species of these fruits found in Toronto's ravines too!  Join avid fruit gardener and City of Toronto Forestry staffer Steven Parkes for a webinar on Toronto's native and edible fruiting plants, their ecological importance and where you might spot them in our urban wilderness. You'll learn how adding these plants to your local landscapes and private gardens can enhance habitats, support local wildlife and pollinators, while producing native fruits and nuts. Please note: this is not a foraging webinar. The focus will be on integrating native edible plants into private gardens.
