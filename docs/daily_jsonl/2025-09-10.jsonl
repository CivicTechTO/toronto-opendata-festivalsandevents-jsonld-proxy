But textiles are quietly doing much more, helping shape the future of healthcare, sustainability, and technology.\n\nThis talk explores the expanding role of textiles across industries and disciplines. From medical fabrics that support healing and safety, to geo-textiles reinforcing environments, to smart e-textiles and materials made from mushrooms or algae-textiles are evolving into tools for innovation and impact.\n\nThis session is especially relevant to those working in healthcare, wearable tech, design, and sustainability, as well as students and researchers across science, engineering, and the arts. Whether you're developing solutions for patient care or rethinking how materials interact with the human body and environment, you'll gain fresh insight into how textiles influence our lives in ways we often overlook.", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/more-than-clothing-textiles-at-the-frontier-of-innovation-tickets-1542523371929?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&keep_tld=1", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/https___cdn_IYRrTn__i1um4LdToRy_sA.evbuc.com_images_1083763623_2288951732143_1_original.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "KITE Research Institute | University Health Network", "email": "Helen.Weston@uhn.ca", "telephone": "6472395637"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Seminars/Workshops"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/more-than-clothing-textiles-at-the-frontier-of-innovation-tickets-1542523371929?aff=ebdsoporgprofile&keep_tld=1"}}
