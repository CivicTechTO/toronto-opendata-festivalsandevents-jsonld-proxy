From burgeoning artists, to favorites you never thought would reunite, to one-off full album sets, a heavily curated and meticulously planned lineup is the festival's key component.", "url": "https://link.dice.fm/u82686a23a97?dice_id=u82686a23a97", "image": null, "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": null, "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Live Performances", "Music", "Other"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "89.62", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://link.dice.fm/u82686a23a97?dice_id=u82686a23a97"}}
