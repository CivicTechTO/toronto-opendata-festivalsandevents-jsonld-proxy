All children's early experiences mould their brains, and the primary caregiver provides most of those experiences. The caregiver's choice of words, tone of voice, gestures, facial expressions, holding, and cuddling lay the neurological foundation for the child's lifelong emotional, physical, and cognitive health. The Program prioritizes families in need of support and is always free.", "url": "https://parentchildmothergoose.org/programs/", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/3iB0gbTwtcGLJLSk8OGr4A", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The Malvern Community Centre", "email": "mgoose@web.net", "telephone": "416-588-5234"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Cultural", "Family/Children"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "url": "https://parentchildmothergoose.org/programs/"}}
