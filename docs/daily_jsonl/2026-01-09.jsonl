Ophis takes audiences on an emotional journey through love, vulnerability, and self-discovery while exploring themes of power, transformation, and sexuality. \n\nWith a modern twist, the production challenges traditional narratives and invites viewers to confront the complexities of identity and power dynamics.", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ophis-tickets-1829926271739?aff=oddtdtcreator", "image": null, "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "", "email": null, "telephone": null}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Dance", "Live Performances", "Theatre"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "60.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ophis-tickets-1829926271739?aff=oddtdtcreator"}}
