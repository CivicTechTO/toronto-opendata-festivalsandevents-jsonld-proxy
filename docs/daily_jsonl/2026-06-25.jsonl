Everyday rituals warp into surreal scenes, exposing the desperation that underpins our search for connection. In this gravity-defying universe, bodies collide and tangle, caught between beauty and menace — both intimate and unsettling.\n\nMontreal's People Watching crafts a vivid blend of acrobatics, movement, and high octane circus that magnifies the absurdity of the everyday. These moments, strange yet achingly familiar, mirror our own desire to hold on, like couples not wanting the last dance to end.\n\nHaunting and exhilarating, Play Dead captures the fragility, absurdity, and fleeting wonder of life lived on the edge of connection.\n\nLa Presse lauds the performance as \"Masterful fluidity, breathtaking…the circus of tomorrow\".", "url": "https://www.luminatofestival.com/play-dead", "image": "https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/c3api-penguin-prod-toronto-storagestack-oc9o88-uploads/RYiOpZFXCMs8gaLgCLHG1A", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "TO Live", "email": "info@luminato.com", "telephone": "(416) 368-3100"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Dance", "Live Performances"], "offers": {"@type": "Offer", "price": "68.00", "priceCurrency": "CAD", "url": "https://www.luminatofestival.com/play-dead"}}
