For over 70 years, Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (born 1929) has invited audiences to experience her groundbreaking visions of infinity. In the past three decades, Kusama has become a global icon, with her work shown worldwide.\n\nThis installation features mirrored spheres suspended from the ceiling and arranged on the floor. A mirrored column inside creates the illusion of a vast, infinite field of silver orbs.\n\nThanks to the generosity of over 4,700 #InfinityAGO donors and the David Yuile & Mary Elizabeth Hodgson Fund, Kusama's work is now part of the AGO Collection.", "url": "https://ago.ca/exhibitions/yayoi-kusamas-infinity-mirrored-room-lets-survive-forever", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/AGO_ufnjbVCMxEn1KQDJ0YxQcw.151397-1200px-72dpi.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Art Gallery of Ontario", "email": "kelly.dundas@ago.ca", "telephone": "4169796660"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "Family/Children", "Museum"]}
