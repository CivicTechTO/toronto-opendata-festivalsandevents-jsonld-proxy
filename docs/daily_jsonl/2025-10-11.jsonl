This exhibition features vintage shopping bags from the library's Special Collections. The shopping bag, just like the shopping landscape, has evolved significantly over the decades, reflecting the times in which they were created. It may seem like a shopping bag is just a vessel for carrying goods, but it can tell a larger story. It is not only a form of advertisement or status symbol, but it can also reflect a moment in time, as well as capturing a piece of design history. \n\nFree guided tours every Tuesday. See details.
