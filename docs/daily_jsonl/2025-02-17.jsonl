We suspect you might just have one or two on your fridge at home! We took a look through our more than 26,500 postcards in TPL Special Collections, and pulled out some of our favourites. Our collection focuses mainly on Toronto, of course, but the collection includes cards from all over Canada and some are made of unusual materials.\n\nFree guided tours will take place on Tuesdays at 3:00pm during the exhibition run. No registration required for the tour.", "url": "https://tpl.ca/tdgallery", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/thumbnail_IMG_9427_kcQpKmHhD0eZQkIOcnU5Ig.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "TD Gallery, Toronto Reference Library", "email": "acherayil@tpl.ca", "telephone": "4163937082"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Arts/Exhibits", "History"]}
