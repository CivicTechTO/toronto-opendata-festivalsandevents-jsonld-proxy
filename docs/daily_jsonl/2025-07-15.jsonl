The City of Toronto is developing a 10-year Circular Economy Road Map to tackle some of today's most urgent challenges — the growing landfill capacity issues, affordability and rising living costs, climate change, and the clear need for more resilient, local systems. The term \"circular economy\" refers to a society-wide approach to production and consumption that aims to eliminate landfill waste and maximize resources by recovering as much as possible. It is a system where everything we use – from buildings and food, to clothing and electronics – never becomes waste. Instead, they remain in circulation through processes like redesign, reduction, reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repurposing, recycling, and recovery.", "url": "https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/waste-management/working-toward-a-circular-economy/", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/banner for circular economy1_WOrEEfkxZM64UksmFP-dCA.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "City of Toronto", "email": "jielan.xu@toronto.ca", "telephone": "4163585874"}, "isAccessibleForFree": true, "keywords": ["Virtual/Online Event"]}
