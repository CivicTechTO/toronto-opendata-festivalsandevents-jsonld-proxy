The terrifying monster from the movie Jaws is what many might imagine when they think of these animals, but they are far more fascinating and complex than their depiction in popular culture.\n\nThis exhibition invites you to uncover fresh perspectives, groundbreaking research, and the astounding diversity of this ancient group of fishes.\n\nVisitors will delve into the anatomy, behaviour, and history of sharks, from familiar favourites like tiger sharks and great whites to lesser-known species like the dwarf lanternsharkâ€”a tiny, light-producing marvel small enough to hold in your hand.", "url": "https://www.rom.on.ca/en/exhibitions-galleries/exhibitions/sharks?utm_source=bloorstculturecorridor&amp;utm_medium=listing&amp;utm_campaign=sharks&amp;utm_content=tourism", "image": "https://secure.toronto.ca/webapps/CC/fileAPI/edc_eventcal/sharkimage_page-0001_WDoZvM1uYSejBqjqVkt0Kw.jpg", "organizer": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Royal Ontario Museum", "email": "info@rom.on.ca", "telephone": "4165868000"}, "isAccessibleForFree": false, "keywords": ["Family/Children", "Museum"]}
