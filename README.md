# Festival & Events JSON-LD Proxy

**A daily-refreshed JSON-LD proxy for Toronto’s Festivals & Events open data feed.**  
Built to help make Toronto the most programmable city in the world.

---

## Function

This project transforms the [City of Toronto’s Festivals and Events dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/festivals-events/) into structured, linked data using the [schema.org/Event](https://schema.org/Event) vocabulary.

The result is a free, publicly hosted JSON-LD feed that enables developers, search engines, and civic tools to discover and reuse Toronto's official event listings in a standardized, machine-readable format.

---

## Purpose

- Demonstrates how open data can power real-world tools with **minimal cost and friction**.
- Enables **events aggregators, civic apps, and open data projects** to work with a common standard and data ontology.
- Bridges the gap between *open datasets* and *programmable cities*.

## Orientation

### Build

> _(Coming soon)_  
> Step-by-step instructions on how to build and run the service locally or in another repo.

### Usage

> _(Coming soon)_  
> Documentation on how to:
> - Access JSON-LD files
> - Use GitHub Pages to consume the data
> - Integrate with apps or schema.org-aware tools
